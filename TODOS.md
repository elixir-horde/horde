## Now
- write mix task to copy migrations into repo migrations folder
- optimize tables with indexes
- process handoff
  - how to put power into the hands of users? ex, maybe you only want to persist state for some processes and not others, depending for example on how expensive the state was to build up.

## Before launch
- finish README
  - getting started guide
